# Shopworks test
I used a set of tools called NX devtools to get the project up and running. Below are the commands to run and test the project.


## Installation

```sh
npm i
```

## Run tasks

To run the dev server for your app, use:

```sh
npx nx serve q1
npx nx serve q2
```


## Run tests

```shell
nx run q1:test
nx run q2:test
```
