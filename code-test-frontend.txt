Question 1: To be completed in native JAVASCRIPT 

With the array (1,2,3,4,5,6), write a recursive function that outputs:

<1>
  <2>
    <3>
      <4>
        <5>
          <6>
          </6>
        </5>
      </4>
    </3>
  </2>
</1>


Question 2: To be completed in REACT
Please provide unit tests for your components.

Using React, create a simple one page form that takes its structure from the JSON config below. 
Normally the config would be read from a remote server but for this exercise you can mock a simple retrieval function which returns this hard coded JSON.

The application does not need to persist the data anywhere other than local state for this exercise. 
Include a simple README.md file with instructions on how to run the application and display the working form.

Sample form config:
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "title": "Tell us about yourself",
      "fields": [
        { "name": "first_name", "label": "First Name", "type": "text" },
        { "name": "last_name", "label": "Last Name", "type": "text" },
        { "name": "email", "label": "Email", "type": "text" },
        { "name": "phone_number", "label": "Phone Number", "type": "text" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "title": "Where do you live?",
      "fields": [
        { "name": "street_address", "label": "Street Address", "type": "text" },
        { "name": "post_code", "label": "Post Code", "type": "text" },
        { "name": "country", "label": "Country", "type": "dropdown", "options": ["Canada", "USA"] },
      ]
    }
  ]
}

After reading the above config, the application should display a form with 2 questions, "Tell us about yourself" and "Where do you live". 
The first question should have 4 text input fields displayed underneath, the second should have 2 text input fields and 1 dropdown. 
All fields should use the name and label from the config (and in the case of dropdowns, the "options" field).

The application should be structured in such a way that you are able to add new questions and fields by updating only the config. 
To keep things simple assume there are only 2 types of field: text inputs and dropdowns.

At the end of the form include a button which prints the current application state of your application to the browser console. 
The output should look similar to the below:

firstName: "Lana",
lastName: "Kane",
country: "Canada",
email: "lana@example.com",
phoneNumber: "555-123-1111",
postCode: "V6B 1S5",
streetAddress: "123 Evergreen Drive"
